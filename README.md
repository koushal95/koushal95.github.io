### Projects
* **Amazon's EC2 Spot Instance Price Prediction**


   Amazon web services provides different pricing models pay-per-use, fixed, and auction-based (spot price). It is seen that the spot price is a minimum of 5 times cheaper than the other pricing models but there is no guarantee that you will be given the instance. It depends on the price you bid. Thus, analysis of historical data for spot price in order to efficiently (minimal cost) schedule the jobs is important.

   Designed and built a model to predict EC2 instance spot price, which enables to schedule EMR jobs efficiently, to reduce the cost incurred to bare minimum. Used Amazon’s price history data and developed the model in Python with results pertaining to error rate less than 1%. 

* **Rest Weather API**

   Built a REST API in Python using Flask to serve the weather data of Cincinnati and deployed it on cloud. Built a model to forecast the weather data based on the historical data, accounting to trends and seasonality of the time series data. The results of the model are made available in the API. Used google charts to display the forecast plot for the next seven days.

* **Optical Character Recognition**

   Performed classification using Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree classifier, and Naïve Bayes classifier to recognize handwritten English alphabet. The work can be extended to diverse applications like assistive technology to blind, automatic processing of invoices, etc.

* **Hearing aid for Deaf using Holograms**

   Developed a mixed reality application using C#, Unity and Windows SDK, to assist the deaf in communication with motivation to provide seamless communication. The application eliminates the cost of a language translator.
